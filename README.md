# OCR_with_Tesseract
The use of Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text from images using Python. Tesseract, an open-source OCR engine developed by Google, is widely used for converting scanned documents and images into editable, searchable text.

# The notebook walks through:
- Installing and configuring Tesseract for Python using pytesseract
- Loading and preprocessing images using OpenCV and Pillow
- Running OCR to extract text from a variety of sample images
- Displaying results and visualizing text regions using image overlays

# Tools & Libraries Used
- pytesseract: Python wrapper for the Tesseract engine
- OpenCV: For image processing and manipulation
- Pillow (PIL): Image loading and display
- Matplotlib: Visualization of OCR results
- Google Colab: Execution environment
